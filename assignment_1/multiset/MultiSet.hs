{- Why MSet cannot be a Functor:
   The Functor laws require fmap id = id and fmap (f . g) = fmap f . fmap g.

   When applying a function that maps two different elements to the same
   result, their multiplicities must be merged. This breaks the structure
   expected of Functor, because multiplicity merging is not transparent.
   Therefore, we cannot make MSet an instance of Functor.
